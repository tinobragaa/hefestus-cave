## User Stories

For the project's advancement, I generated user stories that detailed the essential tasks for achieving a well-constructed website. Following an agile development approach, I then categorized these user stories into 6 distinct epics.

### Deploy with Heroku

1. Go on to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website and [log in](https://id.heroku.com/login) if you already have an account or [sign up](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you don't. 
2. Click on the "New" button on the top right of the home page and select "Create new App" from the drop-down menu.
3. In the "App name" field enter the name of your app. This name has to be unique. 
    - Heroku displays a green tick if your app name is available.
4. In the "Choose a region" field choose either the United States or Europe based on your location.
5. Click the "Create app" button.
6. Next page, top centre of the screen, select the "Settings" tab. 
7. In the "Config Vars" section, click on the "Reveal config Vars" button.
8. In this section you need to enter your environment variables. Usually stored in the env.py file locally. In my case, I have 10 variables: 
    - SECRET_KEY - Django secret key.
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Amazon AWS access key.
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Amazon AWS secret access key.
    - AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME - Amazon AWS bucket name.
    - DATABASE_USER - Amazon RDS database user.
    - EMAIL_HOST_PASS - Email password.
    - EMAIL_HOST_USER - Email address.
    - DATABASE_HOST - Amazon RDS database host.
    - DATABASE_NAME - Amazon RDS database name.
    - DATABASE_PASS - Amazon RDS database password.
9. Copy and paste these variables into the KEY field and their values into the VALUE field.
10. Go back to the top of the screen and select the "Deploy" tab.
11. In the "Deployment method" section select "GitHub".
    1. In "Connect to GitHub" click on the "Search" button. Find the project repository in the list and click on the "Connect" button.
    2. Scroll to the bottom of that page. Click on the "Deploy Branch" button to deploy.
    3. You should also see an option to enable automatic deployment. If you enable this, every time you push to GitHub, Heroku will automatically deploy the app.
12. You will see build log scrolling at the bottom of the screen after that. When successfully finished building the app, you should see the link to your app.

NB: You will need to add your Heroku app link to the ALLOWED_HOSTS in the settings.py file. You also need to make sure that DEBUG is set to False, requirements.txt and Procfile are up to date and pushed to GitHub.
