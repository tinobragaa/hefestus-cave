## User Stories

For the project's advancement, I generated user stories that detailed the essential tasks for achieving a well-constructed website. Following an agile development approach, I then categorized these user stories into six distinct epics on the Kanban board to manage the project's progression effectively.

## Wireframes

To streamline the site's design process, I've generated wireframes for each page, ensuring alignment with industry best practices by producing versions tailored for both mobile and desktop interfaces. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAloavBhBOEiwAbtAJO391J15sKFC7QKvUeqWQ4LfYPMV7B8CcAIxDhhL2wFml7luEHdXmChoCU6sQAvD_BwE) was utilized as the primary tool for crafting these wireframes.

## Database Design

I utilized [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to create an entity relationship diagram, offering a clear visualization of the interconnections among my data structures. This streamlined the development process by offering a comprehensive visualization.

## Agile Development

### GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects was utilized as an Agile tool for managing this project. This platform facilitated the planning and tracking of user stories, issues, and epics, which were then monitored on a weekly basis using a basic Kanban board setup.

- 39 User Stories: full list [here](https://github.com/tinobragaa/hefestus-cave/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc).
- 6 Epics: Development Setup, User Authentication and Account Management, Product Management and Shopping Cart, Checkout and Payment, Content Management and User Interaction and SEO and Marketing.

![Kanban Board](/documentation/kanban-board.png)

### GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues functioned as an additional Agile tool for me. I employed my custom User Story Template within it to organize user stories effectively. Additionally, it facilitated tracking milestones (Epics) for the project.

To see the User Stories list, click [here](https://github.com/tinobragaa/hefestus-cave/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc).

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I broke down my Epics into individual stories before prioritizing and implementing them. This method allowed me to utilize the MoSCoW prioritization and apply labels to the user stories in the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://retro-reboot.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Deploy with Heroku

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host and deploy the website

To deploy your website using Heroku, begin by signing up for a Heroku account. Then, proceed with the following steps:s
1. Go on to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website and [log in](https://id.heroku.com/login) if you already have an account or [sign up](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you don't. 
2. Click on the "New" button on the top right of the home page and select "Create new App" from the drop-down menu.
3. In the "App name" field enter the name of your app. This name has to be unique. 
    - Heroku displays a green tick if your app name is available.
4. In the "Choose a region" field choose either the United States or Europe based on your location.
5. Click the "Create app" button.
6. Next page, top centre of the screen, select the "Settings" tab. 
7. In the "Config Vars" section, click on the "Reveal config Vars" button.
8. In this section you need to enter your environment variables. Usually stored in the env.py file locally. In my case, I have 10 variables: 
    - SECRET_KEY - Django secret key.
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Amazon AWS access key.
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Amazon AWS secret access key.
    - AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME - Amazon AWS bucket name.
    - DATABASE_USER - Amazon RDS database user.
    - EMAIL_HOST_PASS - Email password.
    - EMAIL_HOST_USER - Email address.
    - DATABASE_HOST - Amazon RDS database host.
    - DATABASE_NAME - Amazon RDS database name.
    - DATABASE_PASS - Amazon RDS database password.
9. Copy and paste these variables into the KEY field and their values into the VALUE field.
10. Go back to the top of the screen and select the "Deploy" tab.
11. In the "Deployment method" section select "GitHub".
    1. In "Connect to GitHub" click on the "Search" button. Find the project repository in the list and click on the "Connect" button.
    2. Scroll to the bottom of that page. Click on the "Deploy Branch" button to deploy.
    3. You should also see an option to enable automatic deployment. If you enable this, every time you push to GitHub, Heroku will automatically deploy the app.
12. You will see build log scrolling at the bottom of the screen after that. When successfully finished building the app, you should see the link to your app.

NB: You will need to add your Heroku app link to the ALLOWED_HOSTS in the settings.py file. You also need to make sure that DEBUG is set to False, requirements.txt and Procfile are up to date and pushed to GitHub.

### Custom Domain and SSL Certificate:

This project utilizes a custom domain purchased through [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) and hosted on Heroku.

- To add a custom domain to Heroku, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website.
2. Navigate to the desired app.
3. Access the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "Domains" section.
4. Click on "Add Domain" and enter your new domain (assuming you've already purchased it from a registrar).
5. Proceed to the next step.
6. Copy the _DNS target_ provided by Heroku.
7. Create a new CNAME record within your registrar account and point your domain to the _DNS target_ provided by Heroku.
8. Allow for the propagation period, which may take up to 48 hours.

For SSL certificate management, this project utilizes the free SSL certificate provided by Heroku's [Automatic Certificate Management (ACM)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/automated-certificate-management) system. 

- To add the ACM SSL Certificate, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website.
2. Select the relevant app.
3. Navigate to the "Settings" tab and locate the "SSL Certificates" section.
4. Click on "Configure SSL".
5. Choose "Automatic Certificate Management (ACM)" and proceed.
6. Wait for the SSL certificate to be issued to your domain, which may take up to 60 minutes for propagation.
