## User Stories

For the project's advancement, I generated user stories that detailed the essential tasks for achieving a well-constructed website. Following an agile development approach, I then categorized these user stories into six distinct epics on the Kanban board to manage the project's progression effectively.

## Wireframes

To streamline the site's design process, I've generated wireframes for each page, ensuring alignment with industry best practices by producing versions tailored for both mobile and desktop interfaces. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAloavBhBOEiwAbtAJO391J15sKFC7QKvUeqWQ4LfYPMV7B8CcAIxDhhL2wFml7luEHdXmChoCU6sQAvD_BwE) was utilized as the primary tool for crafting these wireframes.

## Agile Development

### GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects was utilized as an Agile tool for managing this project. This platform facilitated the planning and tracking of user stories, issues, and epics, which were then monitored on a weekly basis using a basic Kanban board setup.

- 39 User Stories: full list [here](https://github.com/tinobragaa/hefestus-cave/issues).
- 6 Epics: Development Setup, User Authentication and Account Management, Product Management and Shopping Cart, Checkout and Payment, Content Management and User Interaction and SEO and Marketing.

![Kanban Board](/documentation/kanban-board.png)

### GitHub Issues
GitHub Issues functioned as an additional Agile tool for me. I employed my custom User Story Template within it to organize user stories effectively. Additionally, it facilitated tracking milestones (Epics) for the project.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
I broke down my Epics into individual stories before prioritizing and implementing them. This method allowed me to utilize the MoSCoW prioritization and apply labels to the user stories in the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: retro-reboot).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://retro-reboot.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Deploy with Heroku

1. Go on to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) website and [log in](https://id.heroku.com/login) if you already have an account or [sign up](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you don't. 
2. Click on the "New" button on the top right of the home page and select "Create new App" from the drop-down menu.
3. In the "App name" field enter the name of your app. This name has to be unique. 
    - Heroku displays a green tick if your app name is available.
4. In the "Choose a region" field choose either the United States or Europe based on your location.
5. Click the "Create app" button.
6. Next page, top centre of the screen, select the "Settings" tab. 
7. In the "Config Vars" section, click on the "Reveal config Vars" button.
8. In this section you need to enter your environment variables. Usually stored in the env.py file locally. In my case, I have 10 variables: 
    - SECRET_KEY - Django secret key.
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Amazon AWS access key.
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Amazon AWS secret access key.
    - AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME - Amazon AWS bucket name.
    - DATABASE_USER - Amazon RDS database user.
    - EMAIL_HOST_PASS - Email password.
    - EMAIL_HOST_USER - Email address.
    - DATABASE_HOST - Amazon RDS database host.
    - DATABASE_NAME - Amazon RDS database name.
    - DATABASE_PASS - Amazon RDS database password.
9. Copy and paste these variables into the KEY field and their values into the VALUE field.
10. Go back to the top of the screen and select the "Deploy" tab.
11. In the "Deployment method" section select "GitHub".
    1. In "Connect to GitHub" click on the "Search" button. Find the project repository in the list and click on the "Connect" button.
    2. Scroll to the bottom of that page. Click on the "Deploy Branch" button to deploy.
    3. You should also see an option to enable automatic deployment. If you enable this, every time you push to GitHub, Heroku will automatically deploy the app.
12. You will see build log scrolling at the bottom of the screen after that. When successfully finished building the app, you should see the link to your app.

NB: You will need to add your Heroku app link to the ALLOWED_HOSTS in the settings.py file. You also need to make sure that DEBUG is set to False, requirements.txt and Procfile are up to date and pushed to GitHub.

### Fork
By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:
